## Hello there 👋, my name is Nathan Drake.
(aka MrDuckington 🦆)

#### Education:
🎓 AAS in Computer Information Systems Concentration in Database Management and Programming
💻 Java, C#, C++, Python, SQL
🗄️ Oracle DBMS, Microsoft SQL, MS Access

I’m an aspiring developer and database designer who loves solving real-world problems with clean and efficient code, while keeping the user-interface simple to use.
My journey from tinkering to building full applications has taught me the value of curiosity and persistence (and maybe a little bit venting to my rubber duck 🦆 when things go awry).


🔭 I'm currently working on refactoring my Word Search Puzzle generator to improve the code and make it more efficient and easier to read.
